# VideoScheduler
VideoScheduler is a VLC-based video player and scheduler for Windows that allows the user to schedule the playing of videos at a specific time. The application current supports movies, TV shows, bumpers, and commercial breaks.

## Installation
The application runs standalone in a ZIP file. To run the application simply download the latest release, extract the files, and run VideoScheduler.exe.

## Upgrading from previous versions
If you are running a previous version simply download and extract the latest release and copy all JSON files into the same folder as VideoScheduler.exe. Always back up your files first.

## Setting up a Library
### Select root folder
When you first start the application, you will be directed to select the root library folder. All content must be contained in subfolders within this folder.

### TV Shows
TV Shows must be in the following folder/file format:
{root folder}/Shows/{Name of Show}/Season {#}/{#}.mp4/mkv

Note that episodes must be in a numbered season folder, and episode filenames must only contain an episode number.

### Movies
All movies should be in a Movies folder in the root folder.

### Other Videos
All other videos such as commercials and bumpers can be organized any way you want. Note: in randomized situations, the folder structure determines the criteria in which videos can be selected, so be sure to organize your videos in a way that videos in a given folder are interchangable.
