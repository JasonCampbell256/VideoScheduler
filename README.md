## Setting up a Library
### Select root folder
When you first start the application, you will be directed to select the root library folder. All content must be contained in subfolders within this folder.

### TV Shows
TV Shows must be in the following folder/file format:
{root folder}/Shows/{Name of Show}/Season {#}/{#}.mp4/mkv

Note that episodes must be in a numbered season folder, and episode filenames must only contain an episode number.

### Movies
All movies should be in a Movies folder in the root folder.

### Other Videos
All other videos such as commercials and bumpers can be organized any way you want. Note: in randomized situations, the folder structure determines the criteria in which videos can be selected, so be sure to organize your videos in a way that videos in a given folder are interchangable.
